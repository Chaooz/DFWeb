So going forward I want to dedicate 1 week for each project every month. The week will be spent getting development up, getting it to run see if I can do some life saving fixes to the project and perhaps make some screenshots. I have no delusion that the project will be 100% finished but maybe in a state where it is good enough. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNot to mention that I have many Amiga projects that are missing for this page and needs to be dusted off and added to my BitBucket collection.
